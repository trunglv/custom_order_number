# Betagento
## Custom Order Number 

### Overview:
This extension is implemented to help you manage an order number more flexible. Default order number functionality of Magento just a simple one, just manages increment numnber. You can do more with my extension.

Example, you want to make an order number like this : `DE-B2B-04-00023`. DE is country code, B2B is a customer group and 04 is a month when an order is created. So please read more detail how to do it with my extension.

### Key features:
- use institute expression to define a order number, example:  `{country_code}-{customer.customer_group}-{month}-{counter}`
- Work for Orders, Invoices and Shipments as well

### How to use it:
