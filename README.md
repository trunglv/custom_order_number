# Betagento
## Custom Order Number 

### Overview:
I implement this extension to help you manage an order number more flexibly. The default order number functionality of Magento is just a simple one; it just manages increment numbers by store scope, and you can do more with my extension.

For example, you would like to make an order number like this: DE-B2B-04-00023. Which: DE is country code, B2B is a customer group, and 04 is a month when a customer is placing an order. So please read more detail on how to do it with my extension.


### Key features:
- use easy-to-use expression to define an order number, example:  `{country_code}-{customer.customer_group}-{month}-{SEQUENCE_NUMBER}`
- Work for Orders, Invoices, and Shipments as well

### How to use it:
#### Configuration
Go to Store >> Configuration >> Betagento >> Custom Order Number
